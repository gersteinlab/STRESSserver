Full Protein Name:  Catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase 
Brief Biological Description:  Kinases constitute a diverse family of enzymes that are responsible for phosphorylating key regulatory sites in target proteins. For the protein shown here, binding to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) results in freeing and activation of the catalytic subunit (shown here), which is capable of acting on target proteins.

Full Protein Name:  Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase
Brief Biological Description:  In order to conserve energy and resources, many organisms employ "salvage pathways" to generate nucleotides starting from similar compounds, rather than building the nucleotides from scratch. Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase is an key enzyme responsible in such a pathway for generating uridine monophosphate

Full Protein Name:  Adenylate kinase
Brief Biological Description:  This protein catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside monophosphate to nucleoside diphosphate. The apo form of the enzyme is shown here.
